#  CHIMPS Robot Project

**CHIMPS (Cognitive Hybrid Intelligent Modular Prototype System)** is a robotics project developed as part of the university engineering program.  
The system demonstrates **autonomous control**, **AI integration**, and **modular robotics design** effectively integrating  mechanical, electrical, and software components into one cohesive system.

---

##  Project Overview
The CHIMPS robot is designed to navigate its environment, make intelligent decisions, and perform assigned tasks using a combination of:
- Embedded control systems  
- Machine learning models  
- Sensor fusion and path planning  
- Mechanical actuation and modular components  

This project emphasizes **team collaboration**, **system integration**, and **real-world problem-solving** in robotics and AI.
