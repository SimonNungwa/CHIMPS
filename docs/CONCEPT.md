# Project Concepts

## 1. Overview
The **CHIMPS Robot Project** is a modular robotic system designed to demonstrate autonomous control, sensor integration, and intelligent decision-making.  
The project aims to combine **mechanical design**, **embedded systems**, and **AI-based control** to perform real-world tasks in a structured environment.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Robotics System Architecture
The robot integrates three key subsystems:
- **Mechanical Subsystem:** Handles mobility, chassis design, and actuator setup.
- **Electronics Subsystem:** Comprises sensors, microcontrollers, and motor drivers for real-time control.
- **Software Subsystem:** Implements algorithms for navigation, perception, and decision-making.

---

### 2.2 Control and Navigation
The control system uses a **hierarchical approach** combining:
- **Low-level control:** Handles motor actuation and sensor feedback loops.  
- **High-level control:** Executes path planning, obstacle avoidance, and task logic.

Key principles include:
- **PID Control** for motion stabilization  
- **Sensor Fusion** for accurate environmental mapping  
- **Autonomous Path Planning** using AI or rule-based logic

---

### 2.3 Artificial Intelligence Integration
AI modules support decision-making and adaptability through:
- **Computer Vision** (object detection, line following, or facial recognition)  
- **Machine Learning Models** for predictive behavior or classification  
- **Edge AI Deployment** on lightweight hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano)

---

### 2.4 Communication and Coordination
The system supports data exchange between components through:
- **Serial Communication (UART/I²C/SPI)** for sensor-to-controller data flow  
- **Wireless Connectivity (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)** for remote monitoring or control  
- **Cloud or Local Server Integration** for data logging and AI model updates

---

### 2.5 Power Management
Efficient energy distribution is achieved via:
- **Battery Management System (BMS)** for safety and longevity  
- **Voltage Regulators** to supply stable power to sensors and controllers  
- **Low-Power Modes** for energy efficiency during idle states

---

## 3. Design Philosophy
CHIMPS emphasizes:
- **Modularity:** Easy replacement or upgrade of components  
- **Scalability:** Supports additional sensors or AI modules  
- **Open Source Collaboration:** Code and design are version-controlled via GitHub  
- **Real-World Applicability:** Built for educational, industrial, or research use cases

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes
- Demonstration of an autonomous robot performing defined tasks  
- Integration of AI-based decision-making for adaptive control  
- A complete open-source documentation of design, implementation, and testing  

---

## 5. Tools and Technologies
- **Hardware:** Arduino / Raspberry Pi, Motor Drivers, Sensors, Cameras  
- **Software:** Python, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), MATLAB/Simulink  
- **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn  
- **Version Control:** GitHub for collaboration and version tracking
